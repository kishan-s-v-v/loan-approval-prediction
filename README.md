# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant financial and demographic data.
The goal is to support faster and more consistent decision-making using data-driven insights.

## Problem Statement
Loan approval involves evaluating multiple factors such as income, credit history, and loan amount.
Manual evaluation is time-consuming and may lead to inconsistent decisions.
This project applies machine learning to automate and improve this process.

## Dataset
The dataset contains applicant information including:
- Gender, marital status, education
- Applicant and co-applicant income
- Loan amount and loan term
- Credit history
- Loan approval status (target variable)

## Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations  
2. Data cleaning and handling missing values  
3. Encoding categorical variables and feature preparation  
4. Training classification models for loan approval prediction  
5. Model evaluation using standard classification metrics  

## Key Insights
- Credit history is the strongest indicator of loan approval  
- Applicant income has a significant impact on approval likelihood  
- Certain demographic features show weak correlation and can be deprioritized  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Results
The trained classification models achieved reliable performance in predicting loan approval outcomes.
Evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix analysis.


## Future Improvements
- Add SQL-based analysis for deeper insights  
- Compare multiple models and optimize hyperparameters  
- Deploy the model as a simple web application
